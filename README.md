# ETL_DataAnalysis_YellowTaxi


### This project demonstrates how to build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Docker containers and Python. The pipeline extracts data from a PostgreSQL database, cleans and analyzes the data, and returns the cleaned data to the database. The project also includes visualization of the yellow taxi data using Matplotlib and Seaborn, as well as data manipulation with Pandas. SQLAlchemy is used for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
